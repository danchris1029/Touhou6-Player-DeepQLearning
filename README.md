# Touhou6-Player-DeepQLearning
Saw the project at https://github.com/feinomenon/TouhouPlayer and wanted to see if I could build a bot that plays Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil by itself.

How to run
------------
Start Touhou 6 - Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, run 'train.py' with administrator rights, click the game's window to gain focus and wait for profit maybe?
