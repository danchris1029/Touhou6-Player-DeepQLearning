# Touhou6-Player-DeepQLearning
Saw the project at https://github.com/feinomenon/TouhouPlayer and and got inspired build a bot that learns to play Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil by itself.

How to run
------------
Start Touhou 6 - Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, run 'train.py' with administrator rights, click the game's window to gain focus and wait for profit maybe?

About this bot
-------------
My attempt at using a Deep-Q-Learning algorithm to train a model which plays Touhou 6.
