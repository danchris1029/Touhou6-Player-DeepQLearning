# Touhou6-Player-DeepQLearning
I saw the project over at https://github.com/feinomenon/TouhouPlayer and and was inspired to build a bot that learns how to play Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil by itself.

How to run
------------
Start Touhou 6 - Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, run 'train.py' with administrator rights, click the game's window to gain focus on it, and wait for profit.

About this bot
-------------
This is my first attempt at using a Deep-Q-Learning algorithm to train a model which learns how to play a game.
